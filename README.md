### Pure shear vs. simple shear

Fig. 6a & 6b compare the two implemented boundary conditions. We chose a hard rectangular inclusion.  
Both codes are completely identical except for line 5

```matlab
ps          = 1;        % ps = 1 models pure shear; ps = 0 models simple shear
```

where in Fig. 6a we activate pure shear, whereas in Fig. 6b we activate simple shear.

### Linear viscous vs. power-law viscous

Fig. 8a & 8b compare the two implemented viscous rheologies. We chose a weak elliptical inclusion.  

In both figures the inclusion is linear viscous. In Fig. 8a, also the matrix is linear viscous, whereas in Fig. 8b the matrix uses a combined flow-law, including a power-law viscosity. More details about the chosen model configuration in Halter et al. 2022.  

Both codes are completely identical except for line 19

```matlab
n_exp       = 5;
```

where in Fig. 8b we chose a power-law exponent > 1.

### Multiple inclusions

Fig. 9 illustrates the interaction between multiple inclusions. This model configuration is calculated on a higher resolution (901 x 601) and can take multiple hours to fully converge.

### Garnet

In Fig. 10 we want to investigate whether we can infer the pressure field inside and around a rigid garnet porphyroblast. To define the shape of the garnet we created a polygon using Matlab's [ginput](https://ch.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/ginput.html) function on a photo of a real rock.

Note the error convergence behaviour. In this example, the (absolute) error reaches a plateau before fully converging to the bottom. This behaviour is typical for the pseudo-transient method.

### Boudinage

In Fig. 11 we show the pressure and stress distribution inside and between 2 separating boudin blocks. Feel free to modify the code visualization to confirm that the horizontal total stress (Sxx) is indeed continuous across the weak gap, as discussed in Halter et al. 2022.

Note that there exist other codes using different numerical approaches (e.g., [MDOODZ7.0](https://github.com/tduretz/MDOODZ7.0)) which are capable of solving the same problem much faster. However, as emphasized in Halter et al. 2022, the beauty in our code lies in it's simplicity and readability, making coding accessible and transparent.

Also note, that the computation time does not increase with non-linearity. I.e. the necessary computation time for Fig. 8b, using a non-linear rheology, is not higher than for Fig. 8a, using a linear rheology. This illustrates the potential of the pseudo-transient method for solving non-linear problems. A more efficient, accelerated pseudo-transient method, used in high performance computing, is assessed and explained in [RÃ¤ss et al. 2022](https://doi.org/10.5194/gmd-15-5757-2022).

Our code can serve as an educational basis for the understanding of such an accelerated pseudo-transient method.
